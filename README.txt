In this directory, you will find two Python codes for the same game (Hangman), one with music (which requires the Pygame module : pip install pygame) and the other without.

If you are unable to install the Pygame library correctly, you can simply run the game without music.

However, we recommend that you try it first with the music because it's really good!
